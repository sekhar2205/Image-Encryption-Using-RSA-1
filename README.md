# Image-Encryption-Using-RSA-1

Image Encryption and Decryption Using RSA 
• Developed an image encryption and decryption system using RSA and AES algorithms to ensure secure 
data transmission. 
• Implemented Flask framework to create a user-friendly web interface for encryption and decryption. 
• Utilized secure key management techniques with RSA for key exchange and AES for efficient 
encryption. 
• Built and tested the project in Python, ensuring compatibility with various image formats like JPEG and 
PNG.
